Herein you may find the OSCAR project, originally developed by John L. Pollock (John), and cared for by yours truly (YT).

The directory structure includes

- [archive](archive), a collection of previous attempts at bringing Oscar to life. Of particular note are the subdirectories:
  - [lisp-originalish](archive/lisp-originalish), a pretty-close-to-original version of John's lisp-coded version of OSCAR.
  - [lisp-revised](archive/lisp-revised), a development of `lisp-originalish` that fixes some bugs and works (such as it does) in the SBCL interpreter. See especially, the latest and greatest version of the [OSCAR lisp code](archive/lisp-revised/monolithic-oscar.lisp).
- [doc/john-l-pollock](doc/john-l-pollock), a collection of works by John that informs my thinking about this project's development.
- [develop](develop), where new (relative to [archive](archive)) research and development takes place.
- [HACKING](HACKING.md), notes on the process of development.
- [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), because we are a "Nation of Lawyers" (h/t Paul Williams).
