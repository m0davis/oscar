import philosophy:
    use highest-level available (easier to write; less likely to need changes when API changes)
    separate 

module creation philosophy:
    reasons to place identifiers in separate modules
        to reduce the need for name mangling (e.g. lazy and strict Text would need different names if they were placed in the same module)
    reasons to place identifiers in the same module
        to avoid orphan instances
        to collect related "functionality"
        instances go with data or class

    identifiers should be placed in separate modules when they are:
        responsible for different domains of a problem
