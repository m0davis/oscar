As a git repository, versions of the project up through 0.3.0.2 are tagged with descriptions in [the archived change-cum-planning-log](archive/doc/HISTORY-and-TODO). More tags of interest are:

- `hasV3.31`, probably tagged to note that it contains John's original (or close to original) lisp code.
- `agdabug-with-433`, probably something about a possible bug in Agda having to do with the `with` functionality, and something about the number 433.

In addition to `master` branch, active development will proceed in `develop`. These other extant branches may be considered not actively developed and may someday be dispensed with:

- bugfind--$-required-for-instance-resolution--version-2
- bugfind--interactive-checked-error-1
- bugfind--interactive-checked-error-2
- develop--add-all-arguments-to-transitivity
- develop--remove-transitivity-function-instances
