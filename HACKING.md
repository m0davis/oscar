For use as a git repository, I have no defined protocol for tagging and branching, except to say that, as of the moment, active development will proceed in `develop`.

Comments in git commits shall usually begin with a [file-or-folder-name].

Versions of the project up through 0.3.0.2 are tagged with descriptions in [the archived change-cum-planning-log](archive/doc/HISTORY-and-TODO). Version 0.3.0.3 is the last one tagged and represents a major change to my approach to the project.

More tags of interest are:

- `hasV3.31`, probably tagged to note that it contains John's original (or close to original) lisp code.
- `agdabug-with-433`, probably something about a possible bug in Agda having to do with the `with` functionality, and something about the number 433.

Aside from the `master` and `develop` branches, these other extant branches may be considered not actively developed and may someday be dispensed with:

- bugfind--$-required-for-instance-resolution--version-2
- bugfind--interactive-checked-error-1
- bugfind--interactive-checked-error-2
- develop--add-all-arguments-to-transitivity
- develop--remove-transitivity-function-instances
