Version history:

0.1.0.0: 
    (feature) The file 'combined-problems' is now parsed into [Problems], which encodes the full syntactic structure.

0.2.0.0: 
    * refactoring
        - use Tagged instead of newtypes?
            unicode utility: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/fui.html8
            Ʈ U+01AE latin capital T retroflex hook
                for empty types (i.e. no value constructors) that are often used with Tagged
            ⁞ for Tagged type constructor
            ƭ for Tagged value constructor

0.2.1.0:
    * refactoring, using StatefulParser
    * lots of haddock

TODO for 0.2.2.0:
    * more refactoring, using StatefulParser
    * haddock

TODO for 0.3.0.0:
    * documentation; see http://jekor.com/article/what-gets-documented-gets-improved
        - remove Oleg's "copyright"
    * decide on versioning & branching strategy; see http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
    * git automation
    * write sample code that shows how this will work: use injective type families in, e.g. DecodedSection when GHC 7.10 is released; this should allow some simplification
    * report haddock bug: unable to provide documentation of a function argument involving an infix type operator unless the type is enclosed in parentheses.
