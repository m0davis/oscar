    * refactoring
        - use Tagged instead of newtypes?
            unicode utility: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/fui.html8
            Ʈ U+01AE latin capital T retroflex hook
                for empty types (i.e. no value constructors) that are often used with Tagged
            ⁞ for Tagged type constructor
            ƭ for Tagged value constructor

0.2.1.0:
    * refactoring, using StatefulParser
    * lots of haddock

0.2.2.0:
    * more refactoring, using StatefulParser
    * haddock

0.3.0.0:
    * add a usage example for ƮWithLineComments (FilePath)
    * first implementation of Control.Lens
    * ReasonSection changed from type to data
    * Section -> SectionName
    * sectionParser -> parserSectionName
    * LispPositiveDouble -> Degree
    * require degrees to lie in the interval (0,1]
    * limit to 80 columns wide
    * consistent presentation of __Examples__
    * fix haddock bug in data ƮSection section
    * clean some messy code
    * remove any unused build-depends from cabal
    * refactor: favor using patterns instead of accessors for ReasonSection
    * fixes for GHC 7.10 compatibility

0.3.0.1:
    * major bugfix in LISP code
    * now developing using the Agda language (this makes much of the below TODO's moot)

0.3.0.2:
    * major cleanup of src-agda
    * add useful type-constructor constructors
    * rename and revise Property to Ṗroperty et al.
    * replace _⇔_ with HasEquivalence in Properthing

TODO for 0.4.0.0:
    * tool: add tests for parsers (or any tricky stuff that isn't checked by the typesystem)
    * feature: implement Variables
    * feature: change [] → Set where appropriate
    * feature: enforce unique names of reasons and numbers of problems

TODO for 0.5.0.0:
    * Fix a problem with making lenses for ReasonSection
    * Should Symbol be a type or a newtype?
    * Should Premise et al. be types or data?
    * Let's consistently use Inference and Interest, and abandon talk of Justifications, Strengths, Premises, and Conclusions.
    * ? ProblemNumber -> Identifier
    * ? ProblemDescription -> Description
    * ? etc. (ProblemPremise -> Premise)

TODO for 0.6.0.0:
    * decide on versioning & branching strategy; see http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
    * git automation
    * Make use of injective type families when GHC 7.10 is released

TODO for later:
    * report haddock bug: unable to provide documentation of a function argument involving an infix type operator unless the type is enclosed in parentheses.
    * implement the rest of Oscar

Meta TODO:
    * documentation; see http://jekor.com/article/what-gets-documented-gets-improved
    * unicode utility; see http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/fui.html8
